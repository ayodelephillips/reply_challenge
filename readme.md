Algorithm
1. Read the input file.
2.Identify Si, Smax, T, and D from the first line.
3. Store all details of the demons in a suitable data structure.
data structure will include the scores, and the 4 constraints.
4. Refer to each enemy using indexes
5. have a look-up(enemy name .e.g. 1=red, ) for each enemy to its index
6. Use a randomiser to simulate the sequence of enemies faced
7. keep track of  sequence of enemies faced, and the score for each turn for each simulation
8. rank the total scores per simulation, then get optimal simulation sequence using the highest score
